Realization: A third-person game where you have to pick up more items than the AI. If the ennemies detect an agent (AI or player) in their Ô¨Åeld of view then the agent is captured and removed from the game. Developed under Unity in C# for COMP521(Modern Computer Games) at Mcgill.

How to play?

- W=move forward 
- S=move backward 
- A=move left
- D = move right
- Space = use one of the two teleport traps: the closest enemy or the closest agent is selected, and immediately moved to a random alcove (agent), or de-and-re-spawned (enemy).
